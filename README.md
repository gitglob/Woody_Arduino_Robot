# Woody_The_Friendly_Social_Distancing_Robot-Arduino-

A mini Arduino practicing project. I made a robot, Woody, who follows everything within a range but stops as 
he understand the importance of Social Distancing!

I used the instructions of this video " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAV5aZ0unag ", but changed it so that Woody can use 
the functions of the servo motor and more.

My main goal was for the robot to follow everything while continuously searching by turning his head left->right and counterwise. 
Whenever he found a Friend (object), it approaches and stops at the safe distance of 10>x>5 cm where Covid19 can't reach him!
It goes back, forth, takes turns, and settles with his head fairly straight (86~94 degrees angle).

My goal was to understand and remind myself of some basic elements of robotics, including but not limited to 
soldering, desoldering, electric circuits, C++, as well as take my first steps using arduino.

It turned out to be a really awesome experience!

Feel free to use the code in any way you want. It isn't perfect obviously, but it does its job decently!
The IR and Ultrasonic sensors are susceptible to noise, so have that in mind!

*Note: I messed up and spilled glue on one of the wheels, so mine get a bit laggy sometimes do to the added friction! ^_^ Oh well...

This is my first arduino project, so be lenient! :)

Me and Woody both wish everyone Luck and Health :D
